# Taoti D8 Base Theme #

Don't doubt our commitment to Sparkle Motion.

This is a base theme intended for sub-themes to be based on. _Subliminal_ is a sub-theme ready for you to customize, see its README for more info.

## Compiling SASS ##

`npm install` to setup SASS stack for theming.

`gulp css` to compile SASS.

`gulp watch` to compile SASS as you edit.

`gulp compile` to comb, compile, and lint your SASS to clean it up to our standards.

Alternatively you can also just `gulp comb` (to actually reformat .scss files to a common spacing, etc) and `gulp lint` (to check for linting errors, warnings are OK but there to make sure you did what you did on purpose).
